Problem Name: Pair sum in a BST
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description: #### Given a binary search tree and an integer S, find pair of nodes in the BST which sum to S. You can use extra space only O(log n).
##### Assume BST contains all unique elements.

##### Note: In a pair, print the smaller element first.

 `Input format:`

`Line 1: Elements in the level order form (separated by space)`

`(If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place)`

`Line 2: S`

`Output format: Each pair in a different line (pair elements separated by space)`


 ##### Sample Input :
    8 5 10 2 6 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 7 -1 -1
    12

##### Sample Output
    2 10
