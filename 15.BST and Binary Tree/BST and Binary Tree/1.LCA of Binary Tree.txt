Assignment Coding Problem
Problem Name: LCA of Binary Tree
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description: ####Given a binary tree and two nodes, find LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) of the given two nodes in Binary Tree. Read about LCA if you are having doubts about the definition.
#####If out of 2 nodes only one node is present, return that node. 
#####If both are not present, return -1.

#####Input format : 
    Line 1 :  Elements in level order form (separated by space)
    (If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place)
    Line 2 : Two integers, Node 1 and Node 2 (separated by space)

#####Output Format : 
    LCA

#####Constraints :
####1 <= N <= 1000
 #####Sample Input 1: 
    5 10 6 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
    2 10

#####Sample Output 1: 
    10

#####Sample Input 2: 
    5 10 6 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
    2 6

#####Sample Output 2: 
    5

#####Sample Input 3: 
    5 10 6 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
    12 78
