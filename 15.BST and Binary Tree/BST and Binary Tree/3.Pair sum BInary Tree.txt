Assignment Coding Problem
Problem Name: Pair sum BInary Tree
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description: ####Given a binary tree and an integer S, print all the pair of nodes whose sum equals S.
#####Assume binary tree contains all unique elements.

#####Note : In a pair, print the smaller element first. Order of different pair doesn't matter.

#####Input format : 
    Line 1 : Elements in level order form (separated by space)
    (If any node does not have left or right child, take -1 in its place)
    Line 2 : Integer S

#####Output Format : 
    Each pair in different line (pair elements separated by space)

#####Constraints :
####1 <= N <= 1000
 #####Sample Input 1: 
    5 10 6 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
    15
