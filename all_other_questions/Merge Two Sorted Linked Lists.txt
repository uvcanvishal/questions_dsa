Coding Problem
Problem Name: Merge Two Sorted Linked Lists
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description: ####Given two linked lists sorted in increasing order. Merge them in such a way that the result list is also sorted (in increasing order).
#### Try solving with O(1) auxiliary space (in-place). You just need to return the head of new linked list, don't print the elements.

##### Input format :
    Line 1 : Linked list 1 elements of length n (separated by space and terminated by -1)
    Line 2 : Linked list 2 elements of length m (separated by space and terminated by -1)

##### Output format :
    Merged list elements (separated by space)

##### Constraints : 
####**_1 <= n, m  <= 10^4_**

 #####Sample Input :
     2 5 8 12 -1
     3 6 9 -1

#####Sample Output :
     2 3 5 6 8 9 12
