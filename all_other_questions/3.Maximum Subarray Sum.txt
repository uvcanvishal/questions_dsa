Assignment Coding Problem
Problem Name: Maximum Subarray Sum
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description: #### Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

#### For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.

#### Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be -1.

#### Follow up: Do this in O(N) time.

##### Input Format:
#### The first line of input contains size of array, which is denoted by N and second line of input contains N space separated integers.

##### Output Format:
#### The first and only line of output should print the maximum subarray sum, as described in the description.
