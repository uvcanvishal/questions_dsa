Coding Problem
Problem Name: BST class
Problem Level: MEDIUM
Problem Description: ####Implement the BST class which includes following functions - 
#####1. search
####Given an element, find if that is present in BSt or not. Return true or false.

#####2. insert - 
####Given an element, insert that element in the BST at the correct position. Assume unique elements will be given.

#####3. delete - 
####Given an element, remove that element from the BST. If the element which is to be deleted has both children, replace that with the minimum element from right sub-tree.

#####4. printTree (recursive) - 
####Print the BST in ithe following format - 
####For printing a node with data N, you need to follow the exact format - 
    N:L:x,R:y
####wherer, N is data of any node present in the binary tree. x and y are the values of left and right child of node N. Print the children only if it is not null. 
####There is no space in between.
####You need to print all nodes in the recursive format in different lines.

#####Note : main function is given for your reference which we are using internally to test the class.
